## What is programming?

Programming is basically giving a computer instructions what to do. Computers talk between themselves using a bunch of verbose instructions (as in: "put this number into this place", "add number x to number y and store the result in z", etc). These instructions are very exact and also depend on what CPU kind or *architecture* you're using.

Programmers instead write in human-readable languages that do the heavy lifting for you. There are many of these languages out there and there are also various ways you can go about writing code.

Programming is not just remembering syntax or knowing a language. It's also about knowing what to do and why you do it. Programming involves a lot of problem solving and practice.

## What programming language should I learn?

In theory, you can start with any language! The important part is that you understand the fundamentals behind what you're learning.

You may also decide to learn a language appropriate for a field you have in mind. If you want to learn how to make a website, Javascript may not be too bad of a starting point. If you want to specialize in automation or data science, Python may be a great choice.

Alongside your programming knowledge, you will also need a healthy amount of problem solving, communication skills, and basic computer concepts (how memory works, navigating a computer, using the terminal, etc). The key point isn't just knowing how to code, but also *what* to code.

## How should I learn to code?

There are many paths you can follow to learning code: books, written articles, videos, interactive courses, etc. However, when mastering any skill, you should always **practice**.

Passively following courses or reading books without doing any work or research of your own is not an effective method of learning. Practicing, on the other hand, gets you into the rhythm of programming, helps you understand how to solve problems you encounter along the way and allows you to gain an understanding of what to do.

A common recommendation is to make projects when learning. Projects don't have to be complex -- they can be as simple as you want. The importance of projects is that you are putting work and effort into learning.

## What are the "fundamentals" you are talking about?

The fundamentals will differ depending on what path you are following. However, most resources I've read have agreed, in one order or another, that the fundamentals include the following:

- What is a computer? What is programming?
- The command line: Getting familiar with text-based commands and knowing how to navigate a computer using one is very helpful when programming. In certain scenarios like when working on a server, sometimes the only thing you get is the command line.
- Input and output: How do you tell things to the user? How do you get things from the user?
- Variables
- Data types (numbers, integers, lists)
- Operators (arithmetic ones, logical ones like and/or, etc)
- Control flow: A fancy term for if statements and loops (for and while)
- Error handling
- Classes: Some languages don't have classes but it is important to know what they are, why would you use them and why others use (or don't use) them.
- Files: it's input and output all over again but with a filesystem!
- Modules and libraries: Basically, knowing how to structure projects and including the work of others (libraries)

## How long does it take to learn `x`?

There is no universal measure on how fast you should learn something. It should not be used as a metric to compare yourself. Humans learn differently and at their own pace. Will it take a few weeks? A few months? A year? It depends a lot on you.

Also, learning is a constant and developing process. It doesn't stop at one milestone. And if there was a milestone, where would that be? Is learning classes the milestone of "learning Python"? Is it finishing a project? Is it knowing topics like decorators or metaclasses? There is no way to measure something that is infinite.

## I'm comfortable with fundamentals, what should I do next?

This is heavily dependent on what field of programming you want to pursue. Projects are also a great way to apply the fundamentals you've learnt and create something you are proud of!

Learning is a never ending path of failure and success.  If you are interested in something, dabble in it and see what you can achieve.

## How should I go about making a project?

First, settle on an idea for something you want to make. Then break down that idea into multiple sub-ideas. Depending on the size of the project, you will also want to plan ahead and understand the challenges you will face.

Get your project to the point it resembles the basics of your original idea. Make sure everything works correctly. Keep extending it with new features until you get bored.
