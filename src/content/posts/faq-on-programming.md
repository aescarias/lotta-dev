## What programming language should I learn?

In theory, you can start with any language! The important part is that you understand the fundamentals behind what you're learning.

You may also decide to learn a language appropriate for a field you have in mind.  If you want to learn how to make a website, Javascript may not be too bad of a starting point. If you want to specialize in automation or data science, Python may be a great choice.

Along your programming knowledge, you will also need a healthy amount of problem solving and basic computer concepts (how does memory work, how to navigate a PC, how to use a terminal, etc). The key point isn't knowing how to code, but *what* to code.

## How should I learn to code?

There are many paths you can follow in learning: books, written articles, videos, interactive courses, etc. However, when mastering any skill, you should always **practice**.

Passively following courses without doing any work of your own is not an effective method of learning. Practicing, on the other hand, gets you into the rhythm of how programming works and how to solve problems you encounter along the way.

A common recommendation is to make projects when learning. Projects don't have to be complex -- they can be as simple as you want. The importance of projects is that you are putting work and effort into learning.

## After I'm done with the fundamentals, what should I do?

This is heavily dependent on what field of programming you want to pursue. Projects are also a great way to apply the fundamentals and create something you are proud of!

Learning is a never ending path of failure and success.  If you are interested in something, dabble in it and see what you can achieve.
