        <h1>About this site</h1>

        <p>
            Lotta Dev is the personal website of <b>√Ångel Carias</b>.
            It also acts as my blog where I mainly write about programming, Python, 
            projects I do, and other interesting things.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is incredibly simple. It is written in 
            <ExtLink href="https://astro.build/">Astro</ExtLink>
            and a bunch of Markdown.
