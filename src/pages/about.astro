        <p>
            Lotta Dev is the personal programming blog of <b>Ángel Carias</b>.

            This website is incredibly simple. It is written in 
            <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" 
               rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a> 
            and a bunch of Markdown.

                🏓 My first time programming was with Visual Basic .NET in 2015 but 
                I didn't really do much until I started learning Python sometime in 2019.
