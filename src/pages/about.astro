    <h1>About this site</h1>

    <p>
      Lotta Dev is the personal website of <b>√Ångel Carias</b>. It also acts as
      my blog where I mainly write about programming, Python, projects I do, and
      other interesting things.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is incredibly simple. It is written in
      <ExtLink href="https://astro.build/">Astro</ExtLink>
      and a bunch of Markdown. It also has an RSS feed for those interested.

        üå± My interests are mainly in programming and technology. I am also

        üèì My first time programming was with Visual Basic .NET in 2015 but I
        didn't really do much until I started learning Python sometime in 2019.

        üèïÔ∏è Most of my projects are in Python, but I have also worked with
        TypeScript and a tiny bit of Rust. I'm currently working on a
