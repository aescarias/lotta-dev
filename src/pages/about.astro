        <h1>About this site</h1>

        <p>
            Lotta Dev is the personal programming blog of <b>√Ångel Carias</b>.
            I mainly write about Python, projects I do, and other development 
            related interests.

        <p>
            This website is incredibly simple. It is written in 
            <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" 
               rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a> 
            and a bunch of Markdown.
